In the dynamic realm of academia, students frequently grapple with the complexities of organizing and managing their tasks amidst a relentless pace. Recognizing the need for a comprehensive solution that could streamline task management, enhance productivity, and offer valuable insights into academic progress, trackED emerged as a  hybrid application.

Built specifically for students, trackED stands as a task management tool designed to efficiently handle and organize academic responsibilities. Functioning as a dedicated assistant, this application empowers students to compile a structured list of scheduled activities, providing a reliable framework for monitoring essential tasks.

The primary objectives of trackED, as a task management application, revolve around delivering an efficient task management service, enhancing students' adherence to deadlines for academic assignments, fostering productivity, and ultimately optimizing overall academic performance. These objectives resonate with the ideals outlined in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, specifically Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being, and Goal 4: Quality Education.
